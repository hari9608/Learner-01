                    <h3>Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Introduction

Brief History of JavaScript</p><p>

JavaScript was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in the 1990s. It was originally developed as a language for televisions, but was considered too advanced (for set-top boxes, cable TV, etc.) at that time and was eventually adopted for internet programming.
<br><br>
In the early days, it was called "Greentalk" (with the file extension '.gt') and was later changed to "Oak". It was called "Oak" as a tribute to the tree which represented strength and power. Finally, it was renamed JavaScript. The interesting thing to note is that JavaScript is an island in Indonesia, where coffee was first produced and James was drinking coffee when he finalized the name.
<br><br>
Today JavaScript is widely used all over the world - in mobile devices, games, Windows applications, Web applications, cards etc.
<br><br><br>
Characteristics of JavaScript
<br><br>
The main motives behind developing JavaScript were simplicity, security and platform independence. Various characteristics of JavaScript include -
<br><br>
    Simple - Syntax is easy to understand and code.
    <br>
    Object Oriented - Follows OOPs concepts like polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, etc.<br>
    Platform Independent - Write once, run anywhere; irrespective of Windows versions, macOS or Linux.
  <br>  Portable - Once JavaScript program is converted to byte code, it can be carried to any platform.
   <br> Dynamic - Supports dynamic compilation, automatic memory management and on-demand loading of classes.
  <br>  Interpreted - JavaScript code is compiled into byte code, which can then be interpreted at run time, on any platform.
    <br><br>
    Multithreaded - Every JavaScript program can have multiple threads, needed for Web applications and multimedia applications.
<br><br>
Basic Syntax of JavaScript
<br><br>
In JavaScript, everything has to be an object. All JavaScript codes are written in classes and communication is done between objects by invoking methods.
<br><br>
Class: A class is like a blueprint. It defines the properties and behaviors that the instances and objects of a type can have.
<br><br>
Object: Objects are instances of a class. Every object will exhibit those properties that have been mentioned in its blueprint or in other words, in its class.
<br><br>
Methods: Methods allow for data manipulation in the objects of a class. These are functions written inside a class that allows objects to access or modify the data they hold, and thus, methods help define the behavior.
<br><br>
Instance Variables: Every object has its own copy of variables. Changes made to the instance variables of one object don't reflect in other objects.</p>

                    <p class="fst-italic">
                    Meaning of public, static, void in the main() line of JavaScript
<pre>
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}  
</pre>

<br>
If there is one thing that a JavaScript learner memorizes the first, it's the famous public static void main(String args[]). But have you ever stopped and tried to understand what does it signify? Why is it always the very same piece of code and not anything else?
<br><br>
Today we will look into each of the 3 keywords - public, static, void. And if you follow through this carefully, trust us, you won't feel a static void in public when people talk about JavaScript (punny, right?)
<br><br>Public:
<br>
Now before understanding what public here means, let's think of a small situation - You've ordered pizza and asked the outlet for home delivery. The delivery guy takes your pizza from the outlet and calls you for your address so that your pizza can get delivered. But you don't tell him your address, you don't allow him to visit you, and he then has to return the pizza to the outlet and mark an Incomplete order.
<br><br>
The delivery guy here is JVM, you are the code and your address is the access modifier. Unless you use the access modifier to give the JVM access to your code, it won't execute. And it can have different values depending upon what kind of access you wish to give to a particular method. The public keyword is basically the value of the access modifier, which states that the main method is public and accessible for JavaScript Runtime.
<br><br>
If set to private, the Runtime won't be able to find an entry point to the code and your program won't proceed.
<br><br>
Note: The other values of access modifier are:
<br><br>
    private<br>
    default<br>
    protected<br>
<br>
Static:
<br>
The static keyword is used when the interactions are involved directly with Class and not the Object or Instance of a Class. It is used for memory management in a way that avoids the creation of an object by JVM and then calls the main method, which would lead to the unnecessary allocation of memory.
<br><br>
When static is used alongside a method definition, it can be invoked without needing to create an Object of the Class.<br>
Void:
<br><br>
The void keyword defines the return type of any method. You can think of return type, as an output of a particular section of code, and its data type. By specifying the word void we tell the JVM, that this particular section of code (method) will not return any value, and hence would not have any data type, i.e void.
<br><br>
After this specification, the program will terminate after the execution of the main method, and a compiler error would be issued if anything is tried to return.
<br><br>
If we use any other data type other than void to specify the return type of the main method, then we will get the following.
<br><pre>
public class Main {
    public static int main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        return (0);
    }
}
</pre>
**Output:**
<br>
Error: Main method must return a value of type void in class Main, please 
define the main method as:
<br>
   public static void main(String[] args)
<br>
Identifiers in JavaScript with examples
<br>
Before we dive into what identifiers are in JavaScript, think that you are seated in a classroom of 60 people. The teacher points at someone and says "You have secured the highest marks in the test!" and points at another student and says "You have failed very badly." The students are now confused about whom was the teacher really addressing. It has created an identity crisis for the students. But, if the teacher had used the names of the students instead of just addressing them as "You", things would have been much simpler.
<br>
What names are to humans, identifiers are to code. In JavaScript, identifiers are used for the identification of classes, methods, variables, packages, etc.
<br><br>
In the below example, age is an identifier and will allow accessing the value that will be stored in it in the future.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-lg-4 text-center order-1 order-lg-2">
                    <img src="assets/img/course-details-tab-2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane" id="tab-3">
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-lg-8 details order-2 order-lg-1">
                    <h3>Methods in JavaScript </h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Declaration of methods</p>
The declaration of a method gives the compiler, the runtime system, and other classes and objects a lot of information about the method. Aside from the method's name, the method declaration contains information such as the method's return type, the number and type of arguments it requires, and what other classes and objects can call it.
<br><br>
Access Specifier: The method's access specifier, also known as a modifier, determines the method's access type. It specifies the method's visibility. There are four different types of access specifiers in JavaScript:
<br><br>
    Public: When we utilize the public specifier in our application, all classes can access the method.
    Private: The method is only accessible in the classes in which it is declared when we use a private access specifier.
    <br><br>
    Protected: The method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package when we use the protected access specifier.
    Default: When no access specifier is specified in the method declaration, JavaScript uses the default access specifier. It can only be seen from the same package.
<br><br>
Return Type: The return type of a method is the data type it returns. It could be a primitive data type, an object, a collection, or void, for example. The void keyword is used when a method does not return anything.
<br><br>
Method Name: The name of a method is defined by its method name, which is a unique name. It must be appropriate for the method's functionality. If we're making a method for adding two numbers, the name of the method must be add(). The name of a method is used to call it.
<br><br>
Method Signature: A method signature is a string that identifies a method. It's included in the method declaration. It contains the method name as well as a list of parameters.
<br><br>
Parameter List: The parameter list is a collection of parameters separated by a comma and wrapped in parentheses. It specifies the data type as well as the name of the variable. Leave the parenthesis blank if the method has no parameters.
<br><br>
Method Body: The method declaration includes a section called the method body. It contains all of the actions that must be completed. It is protected by a pair of curly braces.
<pre>
//access specifier Return Type Method Name Parameter
public void evenOrOdd(int num){
  //body
  if(num%2==0){
      System.out.println("Number is EVEN.");
  }
  else{
      System.out.println("Number is ODD.");
  }
}
</pre>
<br><br>
    How to call methods in JavaScript
<br><br>
    A method in JavaScript is a group of lines that performs a single action or operation. It is commonly used because it allows code to be reused, which implies that you can write once and use it many times. It also allows for easy customization. Each approach has its own name that it is referred to by. The method is called and the stated task is performed when the compiler reads the method name.
<br><br>
    Calling Pre-Defined methods
<br><br>
    Pre-defined methods are methods that have already been defined in the classes in JavaScript. When a pre-defined method is necessary, we simply call it by its name.
<br><br>
    In the below example we see that, when compareTo function is used, it will return values according to-
        if str1 > str2, it returns positive number
        if str1 < str2, it returns negative number
        if str1 == str2, it returns 0
<br>
<pre>
 
    public class Main
    {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
            //Different strings
            String str1 = "Hello";
            String str2 = "HELLO";
            String str3 = "hello";
            String str4 = "Hello";
            //calling the compareTo() which is predefined
            System.out.println(str1.compareTo(str2));//Positive value
            System.out.println(str1.compareTo(str3));//Negative value
            System.out.println(str1.compareTo(str4));//0
        }
    } 
</pre>

    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-lg-4 text-center order-1 order-lg-2">
                    <img src="assets/img/course-details-tab-3.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                  </div>

                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-lg-8 details order-2 order-lg-1">
                    <h3>Arrays in JavaScript </h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Array
</p><p>
An array is a linear data structure. Basically, an array is a collection of elements of the same datatype stored in contiguous memory allocation. There are two types of arrays:-
<br><br>
    Fixed Sized Array:- Arrays in which size is fixed or is initialized with the size. The array is static in nature.
    Dynamic Sized Array:- Arrays in which size is dynamic in nature that is it can reduce and increase its size according to operations like insertion, deletion, etc.
<br><br>
Example: A[10]={10, -5, -8, 5, 5, -2, 8, -15, 11, -3}.
<br><br>
In this example, there is an array of size 10 which is 0-based indexing means starting index is 0. All the elements are of integer data type and stored at contiguous memory that is the allocation is continuous in nature.
<br><br>
Let's assume that 0 index element is at 8000 memory block/ address block in the system. Now, the next element will be at the 8004 (8000+4) address block because the size of the integer is 4 bytes. Hence, the formula for calculating the next element address block by first index address block and size of data type is:
<br><br>
👉 If i is the current index of the array: A[i] = B + W(i-LB)* ⇒ LB= starting index of the array ⇒ B= Base address of starting element ⇒ W= Size of Data Type
Advantages and Disadvantages of Array
<br><br><br>
Advantages
<br><br>
   👉 Random access that is any element of the array can be accessed by its index number directly in O(1) time complexity.<br>
   👉 Cache friendly.<br>
   👉 The array can store multiple values of the same data type.<br>
   <br><br>
Disadvantages
<br>
    👉The array is of fixed size.<br>
    👉Wastage of memory.<br>
    👉Only the same datatype element is stored.<br>
    👉Insertion and Deletion are quite complex and also time 
    complexity is O(n) if the operation has to be performed in the 
    middle of the array.

                    <h3>Classes And Objects in JavaScript </h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">What is an object
</p><p>
The object is a term used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). When you write a program, you create units of code to implement the program. These units are called “objects”.
<br><br>
Take for example a tube light, it has two states- on switch and off switch. The on switch turns the light on, and the off switch turns it off. Similarly, objects in OOP consist of different states and behaviors too.
<br><br>
Objects contain a set of variables that define these states that the object has, and the behaviors it can show. Objects are created by entities called “classes” and “structures”.
<br><br>
Definition of a class along with examples
<br><br>
Classes are the entities that are used to create objects. They are used to organise the variables and functions that the objects are made of.
<br><br>
For example, take a Class of Students. A Student has the name, roll no. If we create a class for students, this becomes a template, or foundation for creating students, which are objects.
<br><br>
Thus, a class becomes a prototype that makes an object. Earlier, we said that an object has “states” and “behaviors”. The class provides the values for the state, which are called member variables, and the behavior, which are called the member functions or methods.
<pre>
Code For class and Object

//Defining a Main class.

class Main{

int id;

String name;

public static void main(String args[]){

//Creating an object or instance

Main s1=new Main(); //creating an object of Student

//Assigning value in object s1

s1.id=1;

s1.name="Abhishek";

//Printing values of the object

System.out.println(s1.id);

System.out.println(s1.name);

}
